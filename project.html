                <h2>School</h2>
                <p>My first school was Seattle World School, which offers a multicultural curriculum, a social justice focus and a wide range of academic and extracurricular activities. Second, I attended Washington Middle School, where I am currently attending my last year. Garfield High School was the third school, but I only studied there for one year because I needed to move to Burien. Lastly, I graduated from Highline High School, which was fun since I was changing schools every year.</p>
